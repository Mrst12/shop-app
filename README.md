## Introduction

This application is built using python, during the first covid lockdown,
we couldn't go to the shops because of our disbled children, so we used to get 
a delivery from a supermarket, there were times because of panic buying,
that we could not get the items we requested, so my husband kept ordering them,
when it came to putting the shopping away, there was no space for the items, as
he did not check the cupboards before ordering. I thought this would be a handy application
for him to save overstocking the cupboards.
