## Final Design

## Introduction

This application is built using python, during the first covid lockdown,
we couldn't go to the shops because of our disbled children, so we used to get 
a delivery from a supermarket, there were times because of panic buying,
that we could not get the items we requested, so my husband kept ordering them,
when it came to putting the shopping away, there was no space for the items, as
he did not check the cupboards before ordering. I thought this would be a handy application
for him to save overstocking the cupboards.

## User Experience (UX)

- ### User Stories

    1. As a user, I want clear instructions on how to use the app.
    2. As a user, I want feedback as I progress throught the app.
    3. As a user, if i get something wrong, I would like to know what that is.
    4. As a user, I want the app to be easy to use.

## Flowchart

## Features

- The application includes a welcome message after asking for the users name(shown in the final product above)
![Start screen](./assets/images/start-screen-python.png)
- It then shows the user the menu in which they can enter a choice. The menu is shown for every selection.
- When the user views the shopping list and it is empty, it will give them a feedback message,
if the shopping list has items on it will list the items.

- The user if they choose to add an item will be asked what they would like to add,
if the item already in the list they will be told, if it's not in the list it will be added.
![Add item to list](./assets/images/add-item-python.png)
- The check and remove item functions are similar to the add item, so the user has consistency.
- There is a clear list function so the user can clear the whole list in one go

- There is an exit function with a feedback message so the user can exit on each selection.
